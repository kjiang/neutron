Blueprints and Specs
====================

The Neutron team uses the `neutron-specs <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs>`_
repository for it's specification reviews. Detailed information can be found
`here <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints#Neutron>`_. Please also find additional
information in the reviews.rst file.

Please note that at the start of each cycle, any BP/spec which did not make it in the release
will need to be resubmitted and approved for the next cycle.
